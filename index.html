  <h1>The Super Guessing Game!</h1>
    <p>This project was designed as part of a Code Fellows assignment. When loaded in a browser, the user will be asked a series of pre-determined questions. First, the user is asked a series of yes/no questions, then scored off their result. Then for the second part, the user is asked to guess different numbers.</p>
      <h2>Part I</h2>
        <h3>Do I live in Seattle?</h3>
        <h3>Do I like to ski?</h3>
        <h3>Do I enjoy playing Eldritch Horror?</h3>
        <h3>Am I Irish?</h3>
      <h2>Part II</h2>
        <h3>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess what it is?</h3>
        <h3>How old am I?</h3>

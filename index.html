  <h1>The Super Guessing Game!</h1>
    <p>This project was designed as part of a Code Fellows assignment. When loaded in a browser, the user will be asked a series of pre-determined questions. First, the user is asked a series of yes/no questions, then scored off their result. Then for the second part, the user is asked to guess different numbers.</p>
      <h2 id="question">Are you ready to answer some questions?</h2>
        <p id="answer">Let's go!</p>

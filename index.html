  <h1>The Super Guessing Game!</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Joshua. You may think you know me really well by now, but I'm about to prove you wrong! I challenge you to a trivia guessing game on the subject of me! If you know the answer to all three questions, you'll win a cool prize or something!</p>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>The JavaScript on this page is really simple atm. The script prompts the user for their name and stores it into a variable called userName. The next piece of script alerts the user with a custom message that concatenates userName into the code.</p>
